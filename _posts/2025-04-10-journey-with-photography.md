I've always been the 'family photographer'. Over the last few years, I have explored the art and technical aspects of photography and the entire production pipeline. I'll breifly explore my journey with the theory, the art, the editing, and more.

# The Beginning: Smartphone Photography
Smartphone cameras have come a long way. Many are capable of taking good but often overedited and oversharpened photos. Despite this being the case, carrying a device that is a *smartphone* and a camera is impressive in itself. The following are images starting from 2019 where I got my first phone, up to 2023 before I switched to taking photos on a dedicated mirrorless camera.

These photos are fine. I'm picking my favourites from thousands of photos across years, but they're fine. Manye of these photos are more documentation that photography, or 'aesthetically pleasing' instead of 'correct'. You can slowly see, however, the development of some core skills including basic composition, emphasis of a subject, and light.

# The Dawn of Sony
The late summer of 2023 is when I picked up the Sony a7iii. I've had access to a sony a55 for a while, but hadn't picked it up. Getting access to the a7iii from my grandfather gave me the pust to shoot and experiment with real dedicated camera photography. Youtube university was helpful to learn the controls and technical aspects of shooting on a mirrorless system, but also planted seeds of the basics of photography.

There is a definite and visible step in quality and focus. Simple as it may be, the transition from smartphones to cameras is apparent.
I personally feel that holding the camera body and 'taking photos' puts you in a different mindset as a smartphone. When I take photos on a smartphone, I feel that these are more for documentation, spontaneous photos, and a very point and shoot feel. As I pick up a camera, it's a different feeling, mindset, and even priorities begin to change. In these showcase photos they were at events of studio-style photographs, but these facts still stand.
